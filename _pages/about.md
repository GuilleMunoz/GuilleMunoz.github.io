## Who am I

My name is Guillermo Muñoz Llopis, from a young age I was interested in the fields of mathematics and fisics.
That's why I enrolled in a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science by the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) which I just finished with a CGPA of 80%.

My interests lie in optimisation, modelling, cryptography and data science. 
In general, I'm very motivated by fields of computer science where math plays a crucial role.

#### Programming

During the firsts two years of my bachelor degree all the programming courses where teached using __Java__. 
At the end, as we got more liberty, I starded programming in __Python__ and it has become one of my favorite programming language.
I also enjoy programming in __C__ because of the unparalleled control of the hardware and performance that comes with the language.

Additionaly I also have experiences using __MySQL__, __R__, __Haskell__, __Prolog__ and __assembly language__.
